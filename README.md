# NOVA - Data Analytics and Mining (PAD) Project 2023/24

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball tournaments captivate millions of fans annually, showcasing the raw talent and strategic process of collegiate athletes, with a business ecosystem that pulsates billions of dollars through the veins of the American sports industry; the choice of analyzing a basketball dataset becomes then a great example of what a professional data scientist working for an NCAA team could do in his workdays.

In this project, we embark on a journey into the heart of college basketball analytics, driven by the conviction that data has the power to unlock new dimensions of understanding and transform the way we perceive and engage with the game.
